My name is Alexander Xincheng Li (Chinese name 李新成; lǐ xīn chéng). I earned my master degree in Finance (2023) and bachelor degree of Economics and Finance (2021) from [School of Economics and Management](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en). Currently, I work for Professor Brian Wu from the University of Michigan, and as a research assistant at the [Center for Internet Development and Governance](http://cidg.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/index/ENindex.html), School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University. My research interests include digital platforms (i.e. TikTok, DiDi etc.) and their related topics. I learn to use various methodologies in my research, including quantitative analysis, qualitative analysis and text analysis. 

More recently, I am preparing for this application season of 2023 Winter. I will apply for Ph.D. programs in Strategy and Economics more specifically. I had two pieces of paper presentation experience. One is at [the Strategic Management Society Annual Conference in Toronto](https://axl811.github.io/talks/2023-09-30-talk-3) in October, and is at [the Academy of International Business Annual Conference in Warsaw](https://axl811.github.io/talks/2023-07-04-talk-2) in July.  


This homepage is designed to be simple but well-organized so that viewers can find information directly and easily. For instance, you can find my [Publications](https://axl811.github.io/publications), [Presentations](https://axl811.github.io/talks/) and [CV](https://axl811.github.io/cv/) either through the upper bar or these links. Likewise, you can contact me via email through the email link located in the sidebar. Thank you!
