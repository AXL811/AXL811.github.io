My name is Alexander Xincheng Li (Chinese name 李新成; lǐ xīn chéng). I earned my master's degree in Finance (2023) and a bachelor degree of Economics and Finance (2021) from [School of Economics and Management](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en). Currently, I work under the guidance of Professor Brian Wu from the University of Michigan on a project, and serve as a research assistant at the [Center for Internet Development and Governance](http://cidg.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/index/ENindex.html), School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University. My research interests include digital platforms (i.e. TikTok, DiDi etc.) and their related topics. I learn to use various methods in research, including quantitative analysis, qualitative analysis and text analysis. 

Here are some more highlights of my academic profile. First, I have a small publication studying the interaction between Trump's tweeting, stock market performance (measured by the VIX ratio), and his disapproval rate. Second, I have two paper presentation experience on the topic of the indigenous innovation strategy as a successful stratgey in China. the paper was presented at [the Strategic Management Society Annual Conference in Toronto](https://axl811.github.io/talks/2023-09-30-talk-3) in October, and [the Academy of International Business Annual Conference in Warsaw](https://axl811.github.io/talks/2023-07-04-talk-2) in July.
