I am Alexander Xincheng Li (Chinese name 李新成 lǐ xīn chéng). I earned my master degree in Finance (2023) and bachelor degree of Economics and Finance (2021) from [School of Economics and Management](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en). Currently, I am working as a research assistant at the [Center for Internet Development and Governance](http://cidg.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/index/ENindex.html). My research interests include digital platforms and their related topics. I use various methodologies in my research, including quantitative analysis, qualitative analysis and text analysis. Notably, I am learning data scraping with Python, which will definitely become a useful way to collect data, aka playing with data. 

My future plan: pursuing a Ph.D. program in Strategy. My ideal destinations are: Harvard University, University of Michigan, University of Pennslyvannia, UCLA, University of Toronto, Duke University. 

I want to make this website is simple but well-organized so that viewers can find information directly and easily. For instance, you can find my [Publications](https://axl811.github.io/publications), [Presentations](https://axl811.github.io/talks/) and [CV](https://axl811.github.io/cv/) either through the upper bar or through these links. Likewise, you can contact me via email through the email link located in the sidebar. Thank you!
