My name is Alexander Xincheng Li (Chinese name 李新成 lǐ xīn chéng). I earned my master degree in Finance (2023) and bachelor degree of Economics and Finance (2021) from [School of Economics and Management](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en). Currently, I work as a research assistant at the [Center for Internet Development and Governance](http://cidg.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/index/ENindex.html), School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University. My research interests include digital platforms (i.e. TikTok, DiDi etc.) and their related topics. I learn to use various methodologies in my research, including quantitative analysis, qualitative analysis and text analysis. 

More recently, I am preparing for this application season of 2023 Winter. I will apply for Ph.D. programs in Strategy more specifically. My ideal destinations are: Harvard University, University of Michigan, University of Pennsylvania, UCLA, University of Toronto, Duke University and others. My detailed preparation work is as follows. I will be presenting my paper at [the Strategic Management Society Annual Conference in Toronto](https://www.strategicmanagement.net/toronto/overview/overview)the coming October. After that, I will visit some US universities for two to three weeks.
